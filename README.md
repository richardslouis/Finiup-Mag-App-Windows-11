# Finiup (Richiesoft)
Finiup Mag [Win11 version]

# Overview

I wanted to share all my works for more than six years of Studio startup & personal project for public usage. I am the founder of Richiesoft Studio where I build enormous app covering consumer, media & ad verticals. This project is one of the repo I had personally stored.

The digital publication of Finiup has come into existence for those entrepreneurial brains to share their experiences, and learn from one another. To become a noted resource of inspiration and education for early stage startup, is what we are headed towards. We are dedicated to accrediting startups with the quality and depth of understanding necessary actions to be taken to succeed.
